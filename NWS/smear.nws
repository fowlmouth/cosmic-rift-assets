~B~1Power Zone~2~B

Welcome to Power Zone.  The object of Power Zone is for your team to capture both of the power flags.  In order to capture a flag you must either kill an opposing flag carrier, or pick it up if it has been dropped.  The 2 power flags are the Shield Flag and the Energy Flag.  The Shield Flag provides the flag carrier and his teammates within a certain proximity with a shield boost.  The Energy Flag provides the flag carrier and his teammates within a certain proximity with a recharge boost.  You may only carry one power flag at a time.

Once you capture a power flag you have a 2 minute timer before the flag will drop.  You must kill a member of the opposing team to reset your flag timer.  Flag carriers get triple points for kills.  After you capture both flags you must hold and defend them for 2 minutes in order to win the game.  Flag carriers will also get 3x the normal points for kills.

The two teams battling eachother in Power Zone are the Orion Belters and the Taurus Horns.  Each team can field up to 8 players.

I shrunk the map down and changed it up a bit.  Tweaked the effects of the power flags slightly as well.
