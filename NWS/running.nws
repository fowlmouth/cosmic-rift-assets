~B~1Seek & Destroy Zone~2~B

Welcome to Cosmic Rift Seek & Destroy.  The object of the game is for your team to capture all the flags.  Once you pick up a flag, you carry it until you are killed.  You get flags by either finding them laying around (unlikely) or killing somebody who has them.

You also have a 5 minute flag drop timer that will cause you to lose your flags unless you kill somebody to reset the timer.  Flag carriers get triple points for kills.  The reward for winning the game grows over time based on the amount of action in the game.

Put new smaller and tighter map up.  Should make things a bit more interesting.
